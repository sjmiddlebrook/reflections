Lesson 2 Reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a git repository creates an empty repository for your work. 
This needs to be done so there is somewhere for you to commit changes to.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is what will be committed. It may not have all the 
files that the working directory has. The repository has what has been 
saved already and files in the staging area may not be in the repository 
yet. The staging area is useful because you can see what you are going 
to commit before actually doing anything.
