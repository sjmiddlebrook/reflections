Lesson 3 Reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

A remote repository could be helpful when you want to share your work 
with others and collaborate on a project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually allows you to have just the versions that you 
need to work on. If Git automatically pulled changes for you then you may 
be unaware of what has changed in the most recent commit or be working 
on a version that you didn't intend to.
